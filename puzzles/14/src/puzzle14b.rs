        // - generated the first 300 iterations, scanned through them by hand
        // - noticed that iteration 12 had a noticeable *horizontal* band of pixels,
        //   and iter 69 had a *vertical* band
        // - saw additional horizontal bands at 115, 218, and additional vertical bands at 170, 281
        // - so the horizontal bands repeate every 103 iters, vertical every 101 iters
        // - guessed that the tree will show up when the sequences (12, 115, 118, ...) and
        //   (69, 170, 281, ...) intersect
        // - find the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as 12 + 103*n and 69 + 101*m for some
        //   integers n and m
        // - that number is 8149, which is the first image with a tree :)
